Description: Web scrape phone numbers along with their associated names/business names (legally).  Some websites prohibit users from
downloading information from their website via bots; however, others make public their company’s contact info (e.g. those that make their
phone numbers available through “Contact Us” or “About” links). The aim of the project would be to create an infrastructure to ascertain
whether names/phone numbers can legally be scraped from websites and extract that data. In addition, should time permit, students should
consider implementing a validation process/portal.
